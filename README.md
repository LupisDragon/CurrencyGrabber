# CurrencyGrabber
A program I wrote on commission to keep track of BitCoin stock

License: This code was created on commission for an individual, and thus should not be altered or used in any way. Any person/s using the code does so at their own risk, and any repercussions on improperly using the code shall be theirs to take on.

What it does: The grabber connects to BitFinex's API and basically acts as a stock ticker (to be used later on).<br>
V2 edits adds an updated API change<br>
V2e makes changes to alterations made by the end user, such as writing to file, and adding candlewidths.
